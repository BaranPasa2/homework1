# Homework 1 Analysis

### Step 1: Importing the data 
First we import the necessary python packages.
`Pandas` is a commonly used Python package for managing data, `os` will be used for saving files to their respective folders, and `tabulate` will be used for creating tables in terminal to confirm our work.

Once the packages are installed we turn the .csv files into dataframes:

`enrollment_df = pd.read_csv(enrollment_file_path)`

`contract_df = pd.read_csv(contract_file_path, encoding='latin1')`

### Step 2: Merging and Cleaning the data
Once that is finished, an inner merge is conducted on Contract Number/Contract ID and Plan ID:

```python
merged_df = enrollment_df.merge(
    contract_df,
    left_on=["Contract_Number", "Plan_ID"],
    right_on=["Contract_ID", "Plan_ID"],
    how="inner"
)
```

After the datasets are merged, redundant columns are dropped and the result is saved to the `output` sub-folder in the `data` folder.

### Step 3: Questions and Tables

Now that the dataset is prepared, the assigned questions can be answered and necessary tables can be created.
